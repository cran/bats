This is a collection of time series functions which are not wholly
unlike those found in S-PLUS.

These functions started off as part of the "coda" package. At the
time they contained only functionality required by coda. They have now
been improved so that they are fully functional, and split off into a
standalone package.

Although I have tried in general to reproduce the S-PLUS behaviour, do
not always agree with what the S-PLUS functions do. Incompatibilities
with S-PLUS are listed in the file COMPAT. There are some known bugs
listed there too, and of course there are plenty of other bugs lurking
in the code waiting to be found.
